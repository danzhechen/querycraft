  - question: "How many total items are in basket A?"
    sql: "SELECT count(*) FROM basket_a;"
    explanation: "Basic count of all rows"
  
  - question: "How many different types of fruits are in basket A?"
    sql: "SELECT count(DISTINCT fruit_a) FROM basket_a;"
    explanation: "Counts unique fruits using DISTINCT"
  
  - question: "What's the sum of all IDs in basket A?"
    sql: "SELECT sum(id) FROM basket_a;"
    explanation: "Basic sum aggregation"

  - question: "How many items have no fruit name in basket A?"
    sql: "SELECT count(*) FROM basket_a WHERE fruit_a IS NULL;"
    explanation: "Counts rows with NULL fruits"

  - question: "How many items have a fruit name in basket A?"
    sql: "SELECT count(*) FROM basket_a WHERE fruit_a IS NOT NULL;"
    explanation: "Counts non-NULL fruits"

  - question: "How many fruits contain the letter 'a' in basket A?"
    sql: "SELECT count(*) FROM basket_a WHERE fruit_a LIKE '%a%';"
    explanation: "Uses LIKE for pattern matching"

  - question: "Count unique fruits that start with 'A' (case insensitive) in basket A"
    sql: "SELECT count(DISTINCT fruit_a) FROM basket_a WHERE fruit_a ILIKE 'a%';"
    explanation: "Uses ILIKE for case-insensitive matching"

  - question: "List each fruit and how many times it appears, sorted by name in basket A"
    sql: >
      SELECT fruit_a, count(*)
      FROM basket_a
      GROUP BY fruit_a
      ORDER BY fruit_a DESC;
    explanation: "Groups and sorts results"
  
  - question: "Show fruits that appear more than once in basket A"
    sql: >
      SELECT fruit_a, count(*)
      FROM basket_a
      GROUP BY fruit_a
      HAVING count(*) > 1
      ORDER BY fruit_a;
    explanation: "Uses HAVING for group filtering"

  - question: "Show fruits that appear twice or less in basket A, sorted by name"
    sql: "SELECT fruit_a, COUNT(*) FROM basket_a GROUP BY fruit_a HAVING COUNT(*) <= 2 ORDER BY fruit_a;"

  - question: "How many fruits appear in both basket A and basket B?"
    sql: >
      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT basket_a.fruit_a)
      FROM basket_a
      INNER JOIN basket_b ON basket_a.fruit_a = basket_b.fruit_b;
    explanation: "This query counts unique fruits that appear in both baskets using an INNER JOIN on the fruit names."
